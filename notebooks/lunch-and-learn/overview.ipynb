    "1. A table is in 1st normal form if\n",
    "  - It stores information in rows and columns where one or more or the columns, called the primary key, uniquely identifies each row\n",
    "  - Each column contains atomic values, and there are no repeating groups of colums\n",
    "2. A table is in 2nd normal form if\n",
    "  - It is in first normal form, and\n",
    "  - All the non-key columns are dependent on the primary's primary key\n",
    "3. A table is in 3rd normal form if\n",
    "  - It is in 2nd normal form, and\n",
    "  - It contains *only* columns that are non-transitively dependent of the primary key\n",
